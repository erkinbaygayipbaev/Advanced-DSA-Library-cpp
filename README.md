# Advanced-DSA-Library-cpp
My personal collection of complex data structures and algorithms in C++. I'm building this to dive deeper into memory management and write code that's not just correct, but efficient and clean.

# Advanced DSA Library (C++)
This repository is a deep dive into complex data structures and algorithms, focusing on high performance, memory efficiency, and clean code principles.

## Goals
* Implement self-balancing trees (AVL, Red-Black Trees).
* Optimize memory management using smart pointers.
* Provide clear, production-ready C++ code.
* 
## Tech Stack
* **Language:** C++17 or higher.
* **Concepts:** OOP, Templates, Memory Management.

## Current Progress
- [ ] AVL Tree Implementation (Coming soon)
- [ ] LRU Cache
- [ ] Graph Algorithms
